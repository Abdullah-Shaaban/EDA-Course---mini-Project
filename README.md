# Min-cut-Floorplan-algorithm
A C++ program that implements the Minimum-area Floorplan (shape function) EDA algorithm.
The output is the minimum floorplan area, its aspect ratio, and percentage of wasted area (core
utilization). As well, each block dimension is stated. The possible dimensions for each gate are function 
of the number inputs, and each gate can be flipped 90Â° (i.e: lengths and widths are interchangeable.)
